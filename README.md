# causality_research
The aim of this research is to find out the potential and limitations of the learning function

I used this family of functions in several cases of machine learning and found that they had a good potential for predicting. 
At that time, the estimation of the learning parameters A, B, C, etc... where made by some brutal Monte-Carlo simulation approach. 

This is, of course not satisfying and, I promised myself to start a more serious study if some more time was awailable. 

This is now the case. My (ultimate) aim is to find out if (for perhaps a certain class of problems) the above family of functions can perform as good as some well established machine learning tool as, for example, the random forest algorithm. 

The best way to start is with the file **causality_search_introduction.pdf** file, that will be made awailable soon.
